        samples with population structure and/or relatedness

Description: The GENESIS package provides methodology for estimating,
        inferring, and accounting for population and pedigree structure
        in genetic analyses.  The current implementation provides
        functions to perform PC-AiR (Conomos et al., 2015): a Principal
        Components Analysis with genome-wide SNP genotype data for
        robust population structure inference in samples with related
        individuals (known or cryptic).
