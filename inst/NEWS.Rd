\section{Version 1.1.3}{
    \itemize{
        \item Added functions for PC-Relate.  PC-Relate provides model-free estimation of recent genetic relatedness in general samples.  It can be used to estimate kinship coefficients, IBD sharing probabilities, and inbreeding coefficients using genome-wide SNP data.  PC-Relate accounts for population structure (ancestry) among sample individuals through the use of ancestry representative principal components (PCs) to provide accurate relatedness estimates due only to recent family (pedigree) structure.
        \item NOTE: This is an early release. While the functions have been thoroughly tested, the man pages are still a work in progress, and the vignette has yet to be created.
        \item GENESIS now imports the package gdsfmt.
    }

\section{Version 1.1.1}{
	\itemize{
		\item Changed a few default values:  MAF filter from 0.05 to 0.01; kin.thresh from 0.025 to 2^(-11/2) ~ 0.022; div.thresh from -0.025 to -2^(-11/2) ~ -0.022; v (the number of PCs returned) from 10 to 20
		\item Changed the argument 'block.size' to 'snp.block.size'
		\item Slightly altered the command line reporting when verbose = TRUE
	}
