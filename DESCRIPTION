Title: GENetic EStimation and Inference in Structured samples
        (GENESIS): Statistical methods for analyzing genetic data from
        samples with population structure and/or relatedness

Description: The GENESIS package provides methodology for estimating,
        inferring, and accounting for population and pedigree structure
        in genetic analyses.  The current implementation provides
        functions to perform PC-AiR (Conomos et al., 2015) and PC-Relate 
        (Conomos et al., In Review). PC-AiR performs a Principal Components 
        Analysis on genome-wide SNP data for the detection of population 
        structure in a sample that may contain known or cryptic relatedness. 
        Unlike standard PCA, PC-AiR accounts for relatedness in the sample 
        to provide accurate ancestry inference that is not confounded by 
        family structure. PC-Relate uses ancestry representative principal 
        components to adjust for population structure/ancestry and accurately 
        estimate measures of recent genetic relatedness such as kinship 
        coefficients, IBD sharing probabilities, and inbreeding coefficients.
